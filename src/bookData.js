          content: `Life has a funny way of bringing people together. Sometimes it starts with a friend, a casual conversation, and a name you've never heard before but will never forget.

It all began with Jabi. We had been friends in Isabela, my hometown—a place where everyone knew everyone, and new faces were rare. Jabi had come from Pangasinan, and somehow, despite being from different worlds, we clicked instantly. There was something easy about our friendship, the kind where you could talk about anything and everything.

One day, during one of our usual conversations, Jabi brought up someone new. "You know," Jabi said with a knowing smile, "I have this friend back in Pangasinan. Her name is Kathleen."

The way Jabi said her name—it lingered in the air, like it carried weight, like it meant something. I was curious, of course. Jabi pulled out a phone and showed me photos of her. And there she was—Kathleen. Even through a screen, there was something about her smile, something in her eyes that caught me off guard.

"She's something special," Jabi said, watching my reaction. "You should add her on Instagram and Facebook. I think you two would get along."

So I did. I sent friend requests, wondering if she'd accept, wondering what she was like beyond those photos.`

          content: `What I didn't know was that Jabi had called Kathleen right after, playing matchmaker. "Hey, my friend CJay just added you on social media," Jabi told her. "Just talk to him. He wants to be friends with you."

But Kathleen's response wasn't what I had hoped for. She had a boyfriend at the time, and she was clear about her boundaries. "I have a boyfriend," she told Jabi. "And I don't want anything long-distance. He's in Isabela, I'm here in Pangasinan. It wouldn't work."

The distance between our provinces felt vast then—Isabela and Pangasinan, separated by hours of travel and different lives. It seemed like an ending before anything could even begin.

But then she accepted my friend request.`

          content: `Maybe it was out of politeness, maybe curiosity, or maybe something else entirely. Whatever the reason, she had accepted my friend request.

When I found out she had a boyfriend, I knew I had to step back. The last thing I wanted was to complicate her life or be that person who didn't respect boundaries. So I laid low. I stopped being so forward, stopped hoping for something that wasn't available.

But I'd be lying if I said the crush just disappeared. It was still there, quietly sitting in the back of my mind. So every now and then, casually, I'd like a post or drop a comment on her NGL links—nothing excessive, nothing that would make things awkward. Just... existing in her world, from a distance.

I told myself I was just being a friend. But deep down, I think I was just waiting—for what, I didn't know.`

          content: `Time passed, and her birthday came around. I greeted her—a simple "Happy Birthday" message, nothing more. She thanked me, and that was it. I kept my distance, respecting the boundaries that existed between us.

Months went by. I was deep into my fourth year of college, drowning in thesis work, late nights, and endless revisions. Life was hectic, but somehow, she was still on my mind.

One day, on impulse, I decided to reach out. Maybe it was the stress getting to me, or maybe I just wanted to know how she was doing. I sent her a message, casual and friendly: "Hey, are you okay?"

I didn't expect much. Maybe a short reply, maybe nothing at all.

But she responded. And what she said surprised me: "I'm not okay."

Those three words opened a door I thought had closed. I could feel that she needed someone, and I wanted to be that person—not because I had an agenda, but because I genuinely cared.

"If you need to talk about anything, or just rant, I'm here," I told her. "No pressure."

And just like that, we started talking again. Not as strangers anymore, but as two people who needed someone to listen.`

          content: `A week passed. I wondered if she was doing better, if whatever had been weighing on her had gotten lighter. So I reached out again.

"Hey, are you okay now?"

Her reply came quickly this time: "I'm okay now. Thanks for asking."

Simple words, but they meant something. She was okay. And maybe, in some small way, I had helped.

A month slipped by—October was coming to an end. Something in me felt the need to check on her again. Maybe it was intuition, maybe just concern. I sent another message: "Hey, are you okay?"

This time, her response was different: "I'm not okay."

We started talking, really talking. And then, unexpectedly, she began asking me questions—deep questions about love. What is love, really? How do you know when it's real? What should love feel like?`

I answered each one carefully, respectfully, meaningfully. I chose my words wisely, not wanting to overstep, but wanting to be honest. I told her what I believed love should be—not what she was going through, but what she deserved.

After our conversation, she thanked me for listening. The way she said it felt genuine, like it meant something to her. We ended the conversation respectfully, and I felt like maybe, just maybe, we had built something deeper between us—a real connection, a mutual understanding.`

A week later, I was scrolling through social media when I saw her posts. Her stories. Photos of her and her boyfriend—smiling, happy, together. They were okay now. They had worked things out.

It hit me harder than I expected. All those deep conversations, all those questions about love—I had helped her find her way back to him. And in that moment, I remembered exactly who I was to her: just someone who listened. Nothing more.

I laid low again, stepping back into the shadows where I belonged. I even told Jabi about it, trying to play it off as a joke. "Hey, they're okay now—because of me," I said, laughing it off. But Jabi knew. And deep down, so did I.

It hurt, but I respected it. If she was happy, that was what mattered. Even if it wasn't with me.`

          content: `Months had passed since I last really talked to Kathleen. Life moved on, as it always does.

I had packed my bags and moved to Manila for my OJT—my internship, the final requirement before graduation. It was a fresh start, a new chapter. The city was busy, crowded, full of possibilities and distractions. I threw myself into work, into the daily grind of commuting and deadlines and learning the ropes of the real world.

I was living my life as a single person, doing what I wanted, going where I pleased. No complications, no heartache, no wondering if she'd notice my likes or my comments. I had laid low for so long that it started to feel natural. Normal.

And somewhere along the way, I started to feel ready. Ready to let go. Ready to uncrush her, as silly as that sounded. She was happy with her boyfriend, and I was okay with that. Or at least, I was learning to be.

I thought I had moved on.`

And just like that, everything I thought I had buried came rushing back. My heart skipped. My mind raced. This was it—a chance I never thought I'd get. A chance to see her, not just through a screen, but in person. To actually meet the girl I'd been crushing on for so long.

The feelings I thought I'd let go of? They were still there, waiting.

I didn't overthink it. I opened our chat and sent a message: "Hey, I saw your note. Are you really coming to Manila?"

Her reply came soon after: "Yes, I am! I'll be staying here for 2 weeks for my affiliation."

Two weeks. She'd be here for two weeks.

My heart was already making plans my brain hadn't caught up to yet.`

          content: `One night, I was out with my friends, having drinks, unwinding from the week. She was doing the same—out with her own friends, enjoying the Manila nightlife. I saw her post a note: "I want ice cream."

I had just gotten myself ice cream earlier. And maybe it was the drinks, maybe it was courage I didn't usually have, but I did something silly. I posted my own note with a picture of my ice cream, showing it off like a trophy.

She replied to it almost immediately: "Give me some!"

I laughed. We started chatting, back and forth, the conversation flowing easy and light. The kind of talk you have when you're both a little buzzed and a little brave.

And then, out of nowhere, she asked: "Do you want to meet up?"

My heart stopped. Did she really just ask that?

"I don't know where though," she added.

"There's a Starbucks near my boarding house," she said. "We should go there."

I didn't need to think twice. "Let's do it."

Just like that, after all this time, all the waiting, all the wondering—we were finally going to meet.`

I went through my closet, picking out clothes, making sure everything looked good. What should I wear? Should I dress up? Keep it casual? I wanted to make a good first impression, even though we'd been talking for so long.

I was ready. More than ready.

Then my phone buzzed. A message from her.

"Are you really gonna come?" she asked.

I could sense something different in her tone. Hesitation. Confusion. Maybe second thoughts.

"Don't come if you can't," she added.

My heart sank a little. Was she backing out? Did she change her mind?

I stared at my phone, trying to figure out what to say, how to respond. After all this time, after finally getting the chance to meet her, was it about to slip away?`

This might be my first and last chance to meet her. She was only here for two weeks, and who knew when—or if—we'd ever get this opportunity again? I wasn't going to let doubt or confusion stop me. Not this time.

Whatever happened, at least I'd know I tried. At least I'd finally see her, face to face, even if just once.

I had made up my mind. I was going to meet Kathleen.

I booked a MoveIt motorcycle, my heart pounding the entire ride. The streets of Manila blurred past me, but all I could think about was her. What would she look like in person? What would I say? Would I mess this up?

And then I arrived at the Starbucks near her boarding house.

And there she was.`

It felt like a dream. Like something I'd imagined so many times that now that it was happening, my brain couldn't quite process it. Her smile, her voice, the way she talked—it was all so much more than what a screen could ever capture.

I'm an introvert by nature. I'm not great with words, especially when my heart is racing. So I did what I do best—I listened. She told me stories, about her day, her friends, her nursing affiliation, whatever came to mind. And I sat there, nodding, taking it all in, just happy to be in her presence.

It didn't matter that I wasn't saying much. What mattered was that I was finally here, with her, sharing the same space, the same moment.

It was everything I'd hoped for, and more.`

I went home that night feeling like I was floating.

But what I didn't expect was what came next.

After that meetup, we started talking every day. Every single day. Good morning messages, random thoughts throughout the day, late-night conversations that stretched into the early hours. It became our routine, our normal.

And I couldn't believe it. After all those months of laying low, of keeping my distance, of trying to move on—here I was, talking to her every day like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Sometimes I had to pinch myself. Was this real? Was this actually happening? Or was I dreaming?

But every time my phone buzzed with her name, I knew it was real. And I never wanted it to end.`

During our meetup at Starbucks, she had told me something important—something that gave me hope but also scared me. She and her boyfriend weren't okay when she came to Manila. Things between them were falling apart.

But now she was going home. Back to Pangasinan. Back to where he was.

And I knew what that meant. Her boyfriend would probably meet her at her house. They'd talk, they'd try to fix things, they'd work it out—just like before. And me? I'd go back to being the friend who listened. The one who waited in the background. The one who laid low.

I had been here before. I knew how this story went.

So I braced myself. I prepared to step back again, to let her go, to accept that this was just a beautiful two weeks and nothing more.`

What Kathleen and I built together was something I could have never imagined.

After she went back to Pangasinan, after her ex-boyfriend failed to show up, after we kept talking every single day—things just... fell into place. We didn't need grand declarations or perfect moments. We just knew.

I started visiting her in Pangasinan. Not just once, but several times. The distance between Isabela and Pangasinan—the same distance that once felt impossible—became just a journey I was willing to make. Again and again.

We spent time together like any couple would. Casual dates, long walks, shared meals, late-night conversations under the stars. We were boyfriend and girlfriend, doing what people in love do—building memories, creating our own world, falling deeper with each moment.

And the connection we had? It was unbreakable. The kind of bond that distance couldn't weaken, that time couldn't fade, that no one could come between.

We had found something rare. Something worth fighting for. Something worth the wait.`

The distance between us is still there. I'm now here in Manila—the company where I did my internship absorbed me, and I'm working here full-time. She's in Pangasinan. Isabela and Pangasinan haven't moved any closer. But we've learned that distance is just a test of how far love can travel. And ours? It travels every single day.

I maintain our relationship by staying loyal to her, by being committed even when it's hard, even when I miss her, even when all I want is to hold her hand. I choose her every day, and she chooses me.`
